    <p><h1>Kasta VA Virtual Assistant</h1></p>
</div>
This is a application in the graphical user interface resembling Siri or the Google assistant in its operation. It has been equipped with many functions, e.g. reading the weather from the API, telling jokes and even saving notes to the database and sending them to an e-mail or phone.

Uses speech recognition to take your commands and process them appropriately. Kasta answers by voice and writes the answer on the screen.

## Motivation

Creating something that we can use on dayli basics esspesially playing music, getting newest weather and newes reports.
Thanks to this project we learned a lot of python modules. Also we gain practical knowladge
of connecting a MySQL database and APIs.
In our apliaction we use database which was created on Google Cloud Platform.

Thanks to this project, we took our python programming skills to the next level.
## Installation

Install Kasta VA with pip:

```bash
  pip install -r requirement.txt

```

If there is a problem with pyaudio installation, use the commands below:

```bash
  pip install pipwin
  pipwin install pyaudio

```
#### Executing program
To execute Kasta VA run main.py

#### Warning! 
The application only works when the database is turned on. When the database is turned off, please contact the authors to turn it on. Thank you for your understanding.
